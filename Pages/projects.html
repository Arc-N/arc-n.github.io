            <p id="pdesc">This project uses DeepQ learning, which is a type of trial and error deep learning method to
                predict optimal controls to beat a game or achieve a certain goal in a virtual environment.
                <br></br>Many data driven
                deep learning methods are limited due to the amount of required pre-labeled data that needs to be
                provided.
                Situations such as the self-driving cars often are impossible to be solved through data alone since the
                data
                on
                all possible ways a car can drive is massive.
                <br></br>Deep Q learning lifts such limitations, focusing on defining
                sets of rules through which the computer can explore a given problem on its own and collect data as well
                as
                learn from it with little to no human input. This is achieved through mimicking how humans learn
                (Reinforced
                learning) with how human brain works (Dense Neural Networks).</p>
