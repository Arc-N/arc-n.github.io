            <p id="pdesc">This project uses DeepQ learning, which is a type of trial and error deep learning method to
                predict optimal controls to beat a game or achieve a certain goal in a virtual environment.
                <br></br>Many data driven
                deep learning methods are limited due to the amount of required pre-labeled data that needs to be
                provided.
                Situations such as the self-driving cars often are impossible to be solved through data alone since the
                data
                on
                all possible ways a car can drive is massive.
                <br></br>Deep Q learning lifts such limitations, focusing on defining
                sets of rules through which the computer can explore a given problem on its own and collect data as well
                as
                learn from it with little to no human input. This is achieved through mimicking how humans learn
                (Reinforced
                learning) with how human brain works (Dense Neural Networks).</p>

                Welcome to the unbeatable tic tac toe.
                <br></br>
                This program uses an algorithm called minimax.
                <br></br>
                The computer essentially calls itself recursively and "plays" every possible move given the board
                arrangment.
                Each move is assigned a score based on the outcome and stored in a vector.
                After the recursion terminates the vector of moves is run through a loop to determine the best score and
                the index of that move is returned as the "goldenMove".
                This is done for every possible empty spot on the board to ensure the best overall move.

            <p id="pdesc">This project uses SFML library (using openGL backend) to generate fractal lines through
                recursion that resemble a tree.
                <br></br>
                The program also allows the user to adjust key variables runtime and see changes taking place live.
                <br></br>
                Each recursive call adds more details to the tree, however the time it takes to render exponantially
                increases.

                After the cleanup, the program uses index.py to create an inverted index that loads the tokenized words
                into a hashtable and dumps it into a pickle file.
                <br></br>
                The Pickle file can then be loaded to be used for simple query searching.
