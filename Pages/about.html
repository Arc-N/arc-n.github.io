            <h3>I have been coding for 5 years now. My passion lies in coding as a whole as I continue to discover new
                technologies.
                I have started off working with simple drag and drop blocks to program robots up to programming software
                with
                both low
                level and high level languages involving complex algorithms and data structures
                <br></br>I have lately been focused on exploring machine learning and solving data driven problems that
                utilize
                Neural
                Networks,
                SVMs, Reinforced learning/Q learning, Convolutional Neural Networks and other techniques involving large
                data
                such as Image recognition,
                pattern recognition, self driving cars and more.
                I love working with both low-level, optimized, fast software code and high level prototyping and
                creating
                AIs
                focused on solving real world problems presented to them in a virtual simulation envionrment.
                Working hard to learn new things is always on my priority list, and I always look to improve or add to
                my
                skillset.
                <br></br>Whether it is medical, games, finance or machine learning, I am always willing to tackle
                challenges and
                come
                up
                with optimal solutions.
                <br></br>One of my distant dreams is to make a robot!
                <br></br>
                Outside of programming, I love swimming, cooking, music and games. Futuristic and Sci-Fi genres are my
                favorites
                when it comes to movies, and I enjoy all sorts of puzzles. My favorite food has to be perfect sunny side
                up
                eggs with salt and pepper.
